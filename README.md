 (Deluxe Paint III like) animation paint system for UNZ(FM-TOWNS emulator) 

![スイカの行進](https://github.com/clouddan4/amiga2/blob/master/SUIKA.gif)

20 years ago, I used Amiga500,Amiga4000,X68000 and FM-Towns(This program).  
Original source skelton is 'Turbo Graphics (PC-9801) by Anzai Tosihiro' and  
 'Computer Graphics (SMC-777) by Anzai Tosihiro' .  

recently, UNZ(FM-TOWNS emulator) was upgrated, and can running EMM386.EXE .  
so, I can update (& bugfix) this program.   

in the future, I want to run this program on DOSBOX(& TP7).  
 and, use 256color(or multiple 16color anims to mix 256color GIFAnim)  
 but I don't have VGA know-how....(T_T)  
(once at time, I bought Delphi3.0 for windows. and, I was discouraged.)
